**Thừa Thiên-Huế** is a [province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Vietnam) in the [North Central Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Central_Coast) region of [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam), approximately in the centre of the country. It borders [Quảng Trị Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quảng_Trị_Province) to the north and [Đà Nẵng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Đà_Nẵng) to the south, [Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos) to the west and the [East Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea) to the east. The province has 128 km of coastline, 22,000 [ha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare) of lagoons and over 200,000 ha of forest. There is an extensive complex of imperial tombs and temples in [Huế](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huế).

## History

The region's history dates back some 2,800 years according to archaeological findings from the Sa Huynh Culture as well as from relics in the region. Đại Việt became an independent nation around 938 BC of which territorial conflict lasts for about four centuries between the Đại Việt and the Champa. The two provinces then changed their names to Thanh and Hóa. In 1307, Đoàn Nhữ Hài was appointed by the emperor, [Trần Anh Tông](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trần_Anh_Tông), to administer the area. The people from the north (Thanh Hóa) migrated south and integrated with the people of the Kingdom of Champa. During this time, had the settlement of Hoa Chau Province began, which included the area of present-day Thừa Thiên.

Between the settlement of [Thuận Hóa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuận_Hóa) (1306) to the founding of Phú Xuân (1687), there were conflicts and uncertainties for the local people, which including the fall of the Trần Dynasty to the renaissance of the [Hồ dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hồ_dynasty). Thuận Hóa and Phú Xuân became the location of the Đại Việt kingdom once [Nguyễn Hoàng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyễn_Hoàng) was appointed head of Thuận Hóa (1511–1558). Lord Nguyễn Hoàng (1558–1613) established bases at Ai Tu, Tra Bat and Dinh Cat, while his lords moved palaces to [Kim Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kim_Long,_Thừa_Thiên-Huế&action=edit&redlink=1) [[vi](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Long,_Huế)] (1636), where they would eventually base their operations in Phú Xuân (1687). The Nguyễn lords ruled the area until it taken over the Trinh clan in 1775. The farmers movement led by the Tây Sơn brothers gained momentum in 1771. The [Tây Sơn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tây_Sơn) insurgent army won the battle in Phú Xuân to take over the Nguyễn capital in 1786, where they continued north and overthrew the Trinh Dynasty. In Phú Xuân, Nguyễn Huệ appointed himself king, and with internal differences with the Tây Sơn Movement and the death of Nguyễn Huệ (1792), Nguyễn Ánh took advantage of the situation and took over Gia Định with the support of foreign forces. Nguyễn Ánh attached to the Tây Sơn movement and took over Phú Xuân and the throne, thereby choosing the dynasty title of Gia Long (1802). Phú Xuân was again chosen as the capital of Vietnam until 1945's August Revolution.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-1) Prior to 1975, the province was known simply as **Thừa Thiên**.

The province is known as an area of heavy fighting during the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War), as it was the second-most northerly province of the [South Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam), close to the [North Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam) border ([DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_Demilitarized_Zone)) at the [17th parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17th_parallel_north). More U.S. soldiers died in this province than in any other province in Vietnam (2,893).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-2) The [Massacre at Huế](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_at_Huế) occurred here; an estimated 2,800 to 6,000 civilians and [Army of the Republic of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam) (ARVN) [prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_War) (POWs) were slaughtered by the [Việt Cộng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong). Thừa Thiên-Huế province saw a large influx of North Vietnamese settlers soon after the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) ended, as with the rest of the former South. This province and neighbouring [Quảng Nam Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quảng_Nam_Province) suffered greatly from flooding in November 1999.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

## Geography

Thừa Thiên-Huế Province borders [Quảng Trị Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quảng_Trị_Province) to the north, the city of [Đà Nẵng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Đà_Nẵng) to the east, [Quảng Nam Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quảng_Nam_Province) to the south, and the [Savannakhet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannakhet_Province), [Salavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salavan_Province) and [Sekong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekong_Province) provinces of [Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos) to the west. The [Perfume River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume_River) (called Sông Hương or Hương Giang in Vietnamese) passes through the province. The province also accommodates the Tam Giang [Cầu Hai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cầu_Hai) Lagoon, the largest lagoon in Southeast Asia, which is 68 kilometres (42 mi) long with a surface area of 220 square kilometres (85 sq mi). The province comprises four different zones: a mountainous area, hills, plains and lagoons separated from the sea by sandbanks. It has 128 kilometres (80 mi) of beaches. The mountains, covering more than half the total surface of the province, are along the west and southwest border of the province, their height varying from 500 metres (1,600 ft) to 1,480 metres (4,860 ft). The hills are lower, between 20 metres (66 ft) and 200 metres (660 ft), with some points at 400 metres (1,300 ft), and occupy about a third of the province's area, between the mountains and the plains. The plains account for about a tenth of the surface area, with a height of only up to 20 metres (66 ft) above sea level. Between the hills are the lagoons which occupy the remaining five per cent of the province's surface area.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-Atlas-3)

[Bạch Mã National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bạch_Mã_National_Park) is a protected area near the city of Hué. It covers 220 square kilometres (85 sq mi) and comprises three zones: a strictly protected core area, an administrative area and a buffer zone. The climate is similar to central Vietnam in general: a tropical monsoon climate. In the plains and in the hills, the average annual temperature is 25 °C (77 °F), but in the mountains only 21 °C (70 °F) (statistical yearbook 2004). The cool season is from November to March with cold northeasterly winds. The lowest average monthly temperature is in January: 20 °C (68 °F). In the cool season temperatures can fall to 12 °C (54 °F) in the plains and the relative humidity is high, between 85 and 95 per cent. Then follows a warmer period from April to September with average monthly temperatures up to 29 °C (84 °F) in July, reaching up to 41 °C (106 °F) at times. It is very humid in July but relative humidity is lower, sometimes down to 50 per cent.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-Villegas-4)

The annual precipitation in the province is 3,200 millimetres (130 in) but there are important variations. Depending on the year the annual average may be 2,500 millimetres (98 in) to 3,500 millimetres (140 in) in the plains and 3,000 millimetres (120 in) to 4,500 millimetres (180 in) in the mountains. In some years the rainfall may be much higher and reach more than 5,000 millimetres (200 in) in the mountains.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-Atlas-3) The rainy season is from September to December—about 70 per cent of the precipitation occurring in those months. Rainfall often occurs in short heavy bursts which can cause flooding and erosion, with serious social, economic and environmental consequences. The floods of November 1999 led to 600 deaths and affected 600,000 homes.

## Flora and fauna

A remote region known as the "[Green Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam's_Green_Corridor)" is home to many species. New species of [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake), [butterfly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly), and [orchid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid) have been found there in 2005 and 2006, as stated by Chris Dickinson of the [World Wide Fund for Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature) (WWF) on 26 September 2007.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-7)[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-8) The scientists discovered 11 new species of plants and animals, including a snake, two butterflies and five leafless orchid [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)). The new snake species is a white-lipped keelback (*[Hebius leucomystax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebius_leucomystax)*). The new butterfly species are the "*[skipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_skipper)*" from the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) *[Zela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zela_(skipper))* and the other from [Satyrinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyrinae). The new plant species also include one in the [Aspidistra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspidistra) family, and a poisonous *[Arum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arum)* perennial.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thừa_Thiên-Huế_Province#cite_note-9)
